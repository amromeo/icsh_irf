<ul>
<li>
<p><details> <summary> <strong style="color:blue;">✔</strong> <strong>R Markdown file:</strong> up-to-date </summary></p>
<p>Great! Since the R Markdown file has been committed to the Git repository, you know the exact version of the code that produced these results.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
<p><details> <summary> <strong style="color:blue;">✔</strong> <strong>Environment:</strong> empty </summary></p>
<p>Great job! The global environment was empty. Objects defined in the global environment can affect the analysis in your R Markdown file in unknown ways. For reproduciblity it’s best to always run the code in an empty environment.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
<p><details> <summary> <strong style="color:blue;">✔</strong> <strong>Seed:</strong> <code>set.seed(20180830)</code> </summary></p>
<p>The command <code>set.seed(20180830)</code> was run prior to running the code in the R Markdown file. Setting a seed ensures that any results that rely on randomness, e.g. subsampling or permutations, are reproducible.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
<p><details> <summary> <strong style="color:blue;">✔</strong> <strong>Session information:</strong> recorded </summary></p>
<p>Great job! Recording the operating system, R version, and package versions is critical for reproducibility.</p>

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
<pre><code>

    Ignored:    .Rhistory

<p>Data was visualized with dot plots overlayed with loess smooth curves. Plot A below demonstrates a non-linear relationship between results from the two analyzers. Logarithmic transformation of the XN IRF results yielded a more linear relationship. As a result Deming regression was pursued using log transformed XN data.</p>

<h2>Deming regression</h2>
<p>A Deming regression model was fitted using the log transformed XN IRF data and the raw DxH data.</p>
<p>Results demonstrate a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.833. Slope estimate was 54 (95% CI 66.428-42.026) and intercept was -12.005 (95% CI 0.986–25.82). The model is plotted below.</p>
